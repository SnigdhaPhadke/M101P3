# M101P3
MongodDB University M101P files upgraded to Python 3

These files are replacements for the python files for homework assignments in the **M101P: MongoDB for Developers** course.

The files included here are not the entire set of files required.  These are just the python2 files upgraded to python3.
So first, be sure to grab all the files from MongoDB University.

The validation scripts are included whenever it was feasible to upgrade them.

This is a timebound repository.  It will be removed or masked at the end of the course since it later lesson files would
suffice to complete ealier weeks.
